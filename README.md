# 💻 My Development Setup for my Mac

If you Google "[My Development Setup](https://www.google.com/search?q=My+Development+Setup)", you'll find numerous articles in which various developers explain what type of setup they have. But more often than not, the articles are very superficial, with one detailed explanation and a list of links to the apps they have and use. I wanted to write a more comprehensive article, in which I can go into greater detail, provide specific examples of my configuration files, and explain how to set up the tools I use, including Virtual Box and Nginx, as well as how I manage custom local domains.


# Let's start

Personally, I’m a very organized individual. I believe that spending the extra time in the beginning will save me a huge amount of time down the road, so having a well-designed development environment is so important to me. Check out the folder structure of this repo and see if there is something useful.
