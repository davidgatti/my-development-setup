Similarly to everything else I keep my iTerm 2 setup as simple as possible. Meaning I have just few changes and only two color schemes:

- [Day view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidgatti/my-development-setup/master/07_iTerm2_setup/itermcolors/red_day.itermcolors)
- [Night view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidgatti/my-development-setup/master/07_iTerm2_setup/itermcolors/red_night.itermcolors)

The key feature of this two color preset is their red color, which I choose for its low energy output. The red color actually caries the least amount of energetic and thus is better suited for dark environment. Which for developers is perfect, since most of us work during the night or in darker places.

If you were also to load the iTerm2 [profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidgatti/my-development-setup/master/07_iTerm2_setup/iTerm2.profile), that I use you'd be able to switch between the day and night mode with the following key combination:

- shift + alt + d: for day mode
- shift + alt + n: for night mode

Which are basically, bright red or a darker variation.
